### Introduction
Welcome to Learning Python: Pig Games!<br>
I'm PIG! And this is the terminal game: "GUESS A NUMBER"<br>
<br>
Oink... I'm thinking about a number. Can you guess it???<br>
There are different options to make it more interesting:<br>
* 5 different difficulties
* Hint mode (for the pig cheaters!)
* Locally-saved scoreboard
* Oink oink stuff

### Install dependencies
They are listed in `requirements.txt` and used to make the game work or style the terminal output:<br>
<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
```conda install --file requirements.txt```
